                    A computer system consists of hardware components that have been carefully chosen so that they work
                    well
                    together and software components or programs that run in the computer.

                    The main software component is itself an operating system (OS) that manages and provides services to
                    other programs that can be run in the computer.

                    In its most basic form, a computer system is a programmable electronic device that can accept input;
                    store data; and retrieve, process and output information.

                <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">They are the biggest and fastest computers (in terms of speed of
                    processing data). Supercomputers are
                    designed such that they can process a huge amount of data, like processing trillions of instructions
                    or data
                    just in a second. This is because of the thousands of interconnected processors in supercomputers.
                    It is
                    basically used in scientific and engineering applications such as weather forecasting, scientific
                    simulations, and nuclear energy research. </p>

                    different processes
                    simultaneously.
                    All these features make the mainframe computer ideal for big organizations like banking, telecom
                    sectors,
                    etc., which process a high volume of data in general. </p>
